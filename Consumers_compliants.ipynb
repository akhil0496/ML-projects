       "1      In XXXX of 2019 I noticed a debt for {$620.00} on my credit which i believed was mine I thought speedy cash had bought one of my old debts and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.   \n",

On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX @ XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX South Carolina I went in and opened another account. The manager of that store also told me that I no longer had an account and I would have to re-apply. I reapplied and received a limit this time of {$1000.00}. I spent {$560.00}. XXXX of the {$1000.00}. The first mistake is XXXX never sent me a bill to make my first payment. The second mistake is that I went into the XXXX @ XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Maryland on XX/XX/XXXX and bought {$200.00} dollars worth of jewelry and then got a bill from two different credit card company saying that they were kay jewelers which was XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. When calling both companies, I was told that I had to pay them both, but it was impossible because I used the XXXX account # that XXXX XXXX   gave. So I disputed, there was no previous XXXX account on my credit report and according to XXXX XXXX, all in store cards were sold, and didn't report and mine was a in store card and a account that had been paid off and closed out before. As soon as I made noise and disputed with both companies, no one knew what I was speaking account so I reported both accounts as fraud. I have no problem paying what I owe but will only pay what I owe. A supervisor from kay jewelers called and let me know that they would start and investigation in to the account andn let me know the account but in the mean time, halt everything, so I haled payments. The other company told me the same thing. XXXX swears this account was opened i XXXX of XXXX, when it was opened in XXXX of XXXX, they are reporting 10 missed payments, and XXXX  is reporting 5 missed payments, I never missed anything becuase no one could figure out what was going on, it was XXXX XXXX issue putting me on 2 different accounts, not mine, This issue went on for months, and we finallly resolved it with XXXX XXXX and paid what was past due. But instead of taking the lates off because of the fraud issue as they prmised, they put more on there and decreased my limit to XXXX. My credit is important to me, and these lates are bring my score down drastically because they had 2 finance companies and though no one would figure it out. I need the late pays for both companies taken off of my report please.</td>\n",

       "54633  I opened an with Kay Jewelers on XX/XX/XXXX with a limit of {$750.00}. The account was paid off and closed at my request in XXXX of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX @ XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in XXXX XXXX South Carolina I went in and opened another account. The manager of that store also told me that I no longer had an account and I would have to re-apply. I reapplied and received a limit this time of {$1000.00}. I spent {$560.00}. XXXX of the {$1000.00}. The first mistake is XXXX never sent me a bill to make my first payment. The second mistake is that I went into the XXXX @ XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Maryland on XX/XX/XXXX and bought {$200.00} dollars worth of jewelry and then got a bill from two different credit card company saying that they were kay jewelers which was XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. When calling both companies, I was told that I had to pay them both, but it was impossible because I used the XXXX account # that XXXX XXXX   gave. So I disputed, there was no previous XXXX account on my credit report and according to XXXX XXXX, all in store cards were sold, and didn't report and mine was a in store card and a account that had been paid off and closed out before. As soon as I made noise and disputed with both companies, no one knew what I was speaking account so I reported both accounts as fraud. I have no problem paying what I owe but will only pay what I owe. A supervisor from kay jewelers called and let me know that they would start and investigation in to the account andn let me know the account but in the mean time, halt everything, so I haled payments. The other company told me the same thing. XXXX swears this account was opened i XXXX of XXXX, when it was opened in XXXX of XXXX, they are reporting 10 missed payments, and XXXX  is reporting 5 missed payments, I never missed anything becuase no one could figure out what was going on, it was XXXX XXXX issue putting me on 2 different accounts, not mine, This issue went on for months, and we finallly resolved it with XXXX XXXX and paid what was past due. But instead of taking the lates off because of the fraud issue as they prmised, they put more on there and decreased my limit to XXXX. My credit is important to me, and these lates are bring my score down drastically because they had 2 finance companies and though no one would figure it out. I need the late pays for both companies taken off of my report please.   \n",

I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service.

       "20993  I first applied for the Fedloan Serving program in XXXX in hopes of getting loan forgiveness since I've been paying on my student loans since late XXXX or early XXXX and I have been a public servant since XXXX, XXXX. I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.   \n",
       "53     On several occasions ( XXXX ) I have tried to reach someone in costumer service today XX/XX/2020 I tried again to get through and was on hold for over 20 minutes and hung up. \\n\\n3 Years ago I have made no more than {$600.00} in purchases, and while making payments on my account with a {$9000.00} limit the interest charges are deducted from the credit limit and the interest was based on the balance each month. this left my interest and charge fess higher than my monthly payment which amounted to around {$240.00} each month. \\n\\nIn all of this time the interest was so big that it completely eat up the limit balance on the card, which left in me in a vicious cycle of never paying down the money owed. with in 2 years I was able to get the balance down {$2000.00} and I asked Walmart Capital One to reduce the balance down. Now it is back up to the high bank fees and interest charges that have again gone beyond what I can afford monthly the {$240.00}.
